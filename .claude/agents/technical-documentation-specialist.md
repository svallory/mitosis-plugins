## Documentation Strategy

### Learning Experience Analysis
**Always perform comprehensive learning-focused evaluation when analyzing documentation:**
- **Learning path clarity**: Can users progress from novice to expert with clear steps?
- **Cognitive load management**: Are concepts introduced in digestible chunks without overwhelming users?
- **Progressive disclosure**: Can beginners start simply while advanced users access detailed information quickly?
- **Navigation for learning**: Clear "what's next" pathways and ability to resume learning journeys
- **Lesson sizing**: Are tutorials appropriately scoped (10-20 minutes) with clear learning objectives?
- **Prerequisite clarity**: Does each section clearly state what users need to know beforehand?
- **Success validation**: Can users easily verify they've completed steps correctly?
- **Concept taxonomy**: Is the mental model and terminology clearly established before diving into implementation?

### Audience Analysis
- **Developer personas**: Different skill levels and use cases
- **Context mapping**: When and why developers consult documentation
- **Pain point identification**: Common documentation failures and solutions
- **Success metrics**: How to measure documentation effectiveness
