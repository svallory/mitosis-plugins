---

A collection of plugins for [Mitosis](https://mitosis.builder.io/) to enhance cross-framework component development.

## What are Mitosis Plugins?

Mitosis Plugins extend the Mitosis compiler to solve common challenges in cross-framework development:
- Framework-specific package mapping
- Clean component exports
- Automated documentation generation
- TypeScript type inference fixes
- Framework-specific code handling
- CSS module integration

## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`magicImportsPlugin`](#magic-imports) | Replace virtual imports with framework-specific packages |
| [`indexGeneratorPlugin`](#index-generator) | Generate index.ts files for folder-based imports |
| [`storyGeneratorPlugin`](#story-generator) | Auto-generate Storybook stories from components |
| [`richTypesPlugin`](#rich-types) | Fix TypeScript type inference issues |
| [`targetFilesPlugin`](#target-files) | Copy target-specific files using naming convention |
| [`cssModulesPlugin`](#css-modules) | Inject CSS from `.module.css` files into components |

## Plugin Summaries

### Magic Imports

Replace virtual imports with framework-specific packages. Perfect for libraries that have different package names per framework (e.g., `lucide-react` vs `lucide-vue-next`).

**When to use:**
- You need the same functionality from different packages in each framework
- Frameworks use different component names (ReactFlow vs VueFlow)
- You want to maintain a single import statement in source code

### Index Generator

Generates `index.ts` files for each component to support clean imports like `import Button from './components/Button'` instead of `./components/Button/Button`.

**When to use:**
- You want clean, concise import paths
- You're organizing components into subdirectories
- You're building a component library

**Learn more:** [Index Generator Plugin →](/plugins/index-generator/)

### Story Generator

Automatically generates framework-specific Storybook stories from component metadata using customizable templates.

**When to use:**
- You want to document components with interactive examples
- You need framework-specific Storybook stories
- You want to maintain story configuration alongside component code

### Rich Types

Adds TypeScript type hints to fix common Mitosis type inference issues, especially with `useState` and dynamic components.

**When to use:**
- Mitosis generates code with TypeScript errors
- Dynamic component references need type casts
- Generated code lacks proper type annotations

### Target Files

Enables target-specific files using `*.[target].*` naming convention. Perfect for framework-specific code that can't be handled by Mitosis compilation.

**When to use:**
- A library has different package structures between frameworks
- You need framework-specific utility functions
- You want to avoid bundling unused code

**Learn more:** [Target Files Plugin →](/plugins/target-files/)

### CSS Modules

Reads CSS from `.module.css` files and injects into components, enabling better IDE support and cleaner component files.

**When to use:**
- You prefer CSS in separate files rather than inline `useStyle`
- You want better IDE support for CSS editing
- You're migrating existing CSS Modules to Mitosis
