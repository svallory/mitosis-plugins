## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue:

1. Check if the issue already exists in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/svallory/mitosis-plugins/issues)
2. Ensure you're using the latest version
3. Provide a minimal reproduction when possible

When creating an issue, please include:
- Clear title and description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (Node.js version, OS, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Please:

1. Check if the feature already exists or is planned
2. Explain the use case and why it would be valuable
3. Consider if it can be implemented as a separate plugin
4. Be open to discussion and alternative solutions

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Keep commits atomic and well-described

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   bun test

   # Run linter
   bun run lint

   # Type check
   bun run typecheck
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add support for X"
   ```

   We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` New feature
   - `fix:` Bug fix
   - `docs:` Documentation changes
   - `test:` Test additions or changes
   - `refactor:` Code refactoring
   - `chore:` Maintenance tasks

5. **Push and create a PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing formatting (we use Prettier)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Add integration tests for plugin interactions
- Test with real Mitosis projects when possible

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update plugin-specific documentation in `src/`
- Add code examples for new configurations
- Keep documentation clear and concise

## Plugin Development

### Creating a New Plugin

1. Create a new directory in `src/`:
   ```bash
   mkdir src/my-plugin
   ```

2. Create the plugin structure:

   <FileTree>
   - src/my-plugin/
     - index.ts Main plugin export
     - plugin.ts Plugin implementation
     - README.md Plugin documentation
     - tests/ Plugin tests
       - plugin.test.ts
   </FileTree>

3. Export from main index:
   ```typescript
   // src/index.ts
   export { myPlugin } from './my-plugin';
   ```

4. Follow existing plugin patterns for consistency

### Plugin Best Practices

- Use the appropriate Mitosis hook (`code.pre`, `json.post`, etc.)
- Provide sensible defaults
- Make configuration optional when possible
- Add debug logging for troubleshooting
- Handle errors gracefully
- Document all configuration options

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers:

1. Version bumps follow semantic versioning
2. Changelog is auto-generated from conventional commits
3. GitHub releases are created with release notes
4. Package is published to npm

## Getting Help

- Check existing documentation and examples
- Look through existing issues and discussions
- Ask questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/svallory/mitosis-plugins/discussions)
- Open an issue if you need clarification

## Recognition

Contributors are recognized in:
- Release notes for significant contributions
- README.md contributors section (for major contributions)
- Repository insights/graphs
